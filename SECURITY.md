- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the vulnerability
- Suggested fix (if any)

### Response Timeline

- We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Implementation (v1.0.0)

⚠️ **Important Security Notes for Production Deployment:**

1. **Password Storage**
   - Current: Plain text storage
   - Required: Implement bcrypt/Werkzeug password hashing
   - Priority: HIGH

2. **Session Security**
   - Use secure session configuration
   - Set `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True` for HTTPS
   - Set `SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY = True`
   - Set `SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE = 'Lax'`

3. **Database**
   - Current: SQLite (suitable for development)
   - Production: Consider PostgreSQL or MySQL
   - Implement regular backups

4. **Input Validation**
   - Add comprehensive input validation
   - Implement CSRF protection (Flask-WTF)
   - Sanitize user inputs
   - Validate file uploads (if implemented)

5. **Authentication**
   - Implement rate limiting on login attempts
   - Add password strength requirements
   - Consider two-factor authentication
   - Implement account lockout after failed attempts

6. **Secret Key**
   - Change default secret key
   - Use environment variables
   - Never commit secrets to version control

## Security Best Practices for Deployment

### Before Going to Production

```python
# Example secure configuration

import os
from datetime import timedelta

class Config:
    # Secret key from environment
    SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY') or os.urandom(32)
    
    # Database
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL')
    SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = False
    
    # Session
    SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True
    SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY = True
    SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE = 'Lax'
    PERMANENT_SESSION_LIFETIME = timedelta(hours=1)
    
    # CSRF Protection
    WTF_CSRF_ENABLED = True
    WTF_CSRF_TIME_LIMIT = None
    
    # Security Headers
    SECURITY_HEADERS = {
        'Strict-Transport-Security': 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains',
        'X-Content-Type-Options': 'nosniff',
        'X-Frame-Options': 'SAMEORIGIN',
        'X-XSS-Protection': '1; mode=block'
    }
```

### Recommended Security Packages

```bash
pip install flask-talisman      # HTTPS enforcement and security headers
pip install flask-limiter       # Rate limiting
pip install flask-wtf           # CSRF protection
pip install bcrypt              # Password hashing
pip install python-dotenv       # Environment variables
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file (never commit this):

```env
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
DATABASE_URL=your-database-url
FLASK_ENV=production
FLASK_DEBUG=False
```

### HTTPS Configuration

Always use HTTPS in production:

```python
from flask_talisman import Talisman

app = Flask(__name__)
Talisman(app, force_https=True)
```

## Security Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Change default secret key
- [ ] Implement password hashing (bcrypt)
- [ ] Enable CSRF protection
- [ ] Configure secure session cookies
- [ ] Use environment variables for sensitive data
- [ ] Enable HTTPS with valid SSL certificate
- [ ] Implement rate limiting on login
- [ ] Add input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Use production-grade database (PostgreSQL/MySQL)
- [ ] Set up database backups
- [ ] Configure security headers
- [ ] Disable debug mode
- [ ] Implement logging and monitoring
- [ ] Regular security updates
- [ ] Code review for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Penetration testing

## Common Vulnerabilities to Prevent

### SQL Injection
- ✅ Using SQLAlchemy ORM (parameterized queries)
- Still verify: User inputs in raw SQL (if any)

### XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
- ✅ Jinja2 auto-escapes by default
- Verify: All user-generated content is escaped

### CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
- ⚠️ Need to implement: Flask-WTF CSRF protection

### Session Hijacking
- ⚠️ Implement: Secure cookie configuration
- ⚠️ Implement: HTTPS enforcement

### Password Security
- ❌ Critical: Currently using plain text
- ⚠️ Must implement: Password hashing

### Authorization Issues
- ✅ Role-based access control implemented
- Verify: All routes check user permissions

## Regular Security Maintenance

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**
   ```bash
   pip list --outdated
   pip install --upgrade package-name
   ```

2. **Security Audits**
   ```bash
   pip install safety
   safety check
   ```

3. **Code Analysis**
   ```bash
   pip install bandit
   bandit -r .
   ```

## Incident Response Plan

If a security incident occurs:

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Take affected systems offline if necessary
   - Preserve evidence and logs
   - Assess the scope of the breach

2. **Investigation**
   - Identify the vulnerability
   - Determine what data was affected
   - Document the incident

3. **Remediation**
   - Fix the vulnerability
   - Update affected systems
   - Reset compromised credentials

4. **Communication**
   - Notify affected users
   - Provide clear information about the incident
   - Explain steps taken to prevent recurrence

5. **Post-Incident**
   - Conduct post-mortem analysis
   - Update security measures
   - Improve monitoring and detection
